skroutz-feed-verifier
=====================

A feed verifier for popular skroutz.gr feeds. Will be enhanced with findings from the process of getting into skroutz.gr.


The verifier is packaged as a standalone "jar" executable. Use "java -jar <filename.jar>" to launch it. Errors will be reported in the console (for the moment in Greek and English).
